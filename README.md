# SQL-Injection-Lab


## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Sql injection lab from LetsDefend helped me enhance my practical skills in identifying and mitigating SQL injection attacks within web applications. For this lab,I searched for vulnerabiltiites within web apachi logs.I discovered the exploitation phase of when the SQL injection attack occured,identified the type of SQL injection attack, and uncovered the IP address of the attacker who performed the attack. This hands on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of web application security. 


### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Web Server Log Analysis – Reviewed Apache access/error logs to detect SQL injection attempts and other web-based attacks.
- Incident Response & Forensics – Investigated SQLi attacks, documented findings, and provided remediation steps.
- Mitigation & Defense Strategie- Implentmented input validation to prevent SQL attacks in the future. 
- Secure Coding Awareness – Gained knowledge of secure web development practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Followed structured offensive security methodologies (e.g., OWASP Top 10, PTES) to identify and exploit SQLi vulnerabilities.

### What is a SQL injection attack?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec6fde7a-d68d-4a69-9e1c-e35676c119a7)
A SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where a hacker tricks a website into giving them unauthorized access to its database.
 
### How Does SQL injections work?
SQL injections attacks occur when hackers take advantage of weak spots in websites that store and manage information. They sneak in harmful code through text boxes like login screens or search bars. If the website isn’t set up to block this, the database follows the hacker’s commands. This can lead to the hacker breaking into accounts without a password, change or delete important information, and take control fo the database system.

### Ref 1: Apache Access Logs
In this letsdefend lab, I have access logs of a web application that was the victim of a SQL injection attack.
