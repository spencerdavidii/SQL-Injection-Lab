# SQL-Injection-Lab


## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Sql injection lab from LetsDefend helped me enhance my practical skills in identifying and mitigating SQL injection attacks within web applications. For this lab,I searched for vulnerabiltiites within web apachi logs.I discovered the exploitation phase of when the SQL injection attack occured,identified the type of SQL injection attack, and uncovered the IP address of the attacker who performed the attack. This hands on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of web application security.
