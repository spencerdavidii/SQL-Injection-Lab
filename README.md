# SQL-Injection-Lab


## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Sql injection lab from LetsDefend helped me enhance my practical skills in identifying and mitigating SQL injection attacks within web applications. For this lab,I searched for vulnerabiltiites within web apachi logs.I discovered the exploitation phase of when the SQL injection attack occured,identified the type of SQL injection attack, and uncovered the IP address of the attacker who performed the attack. This hands on experience was designed to deepen my understanding of web application security. 


### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Web Server Log Analysis – Reviewed Apache access/error logs to detect SQL injection attempts and other web-based attacks.
- Incident Response & Forensics – Investigated SQLi attacks, documented findings, and provided remediation steps.
- Mitigation & Defense Strategie- Implentmented input validation to prevent SQL attacks in the future. 
- Secure Coding Awareness – Gained knowledge of secure web development practices to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
- Followed structured offensive security methodologies (e.g., OWASP Top 10, PTES) to identify and exploit SQLi vulnerabilities.

### What is a SQL injection attack?

A SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where a hacker tricks a website into giving them unauthorized access to its database.
 
This can let the hacker:

✔️ Steal personal data (like usernames and passwords)
✔️ Change or delete important information
✔️ Even take control of the entire system

In this letsdefend lab, I have access logs of a web application that was the victim of a SQL injection attack.
